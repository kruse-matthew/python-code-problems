# python-code-problems
This project is for python test coding problems.  It leverages Jupiter Notebooks as an easy way for creating test problems.

Things to look for in solutions:
    1. Does it works for all inputs?
    2. Does it leverage python casing, commenting, and functioinality.
    3. Is it leveraging typing?  Does it make sense to have typing?
    4. Is it testable?
